# Technologies Used

## Data Extracting and Cleaning
A csv file was pulled from census.gov to show the population, income, demophraphics and other San diego statics. Using pandas the CSV is read into a jupyter notebook
where we will clean and prepare the data to stored.
## Database Storage
PostGres is being used as our relational database to futher connect and disscect the data.
## Unsupervised Machine Learning Model
We will create an unsupervised machine learning model using KMeans from SKLearn to form clusters to further evaluate our data. 
## Dashboard
To visually display our data we will be using HTML webpage linked to Tableau storyboard.
