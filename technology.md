# Technologies Used

## Data Extracting and Cleaning
A csv file was pulled from census.gov to show the population, income, and demographics. From webscraping and using geopy, we extracted the names and locations of parks, hospitals, shopping markets, and schools. Using pandas the CSV's is read into a jupyter notebook to be cleaned and sorted through.
## Database Storage
PostGres is being used as our relational database to futher connect all the data we have pulled and webscraped.
## Unsupervised Machine Learning Model
We will create an unsupervised machine learning model using KMeans from SKLearn to form clusters to further evaluate to make decisions for what data to display. 
## Dashboard
To visually display our data we will be using HTML webpage linked to Tableau storyboard.
